STORYLINE
---------

Things were going so well for you. Having completed Kitchen University, you had gone off into the world and found yourself a job as a chef. Your skill with a spatula and dexterity with a rolling pin quickly paid off, and your fame was rising. But your rise in success was matched by a more sinister rise: The ire of the local food critic, Hugo. Having himself flunked out of Kitchen University, he wanted nothing more than to see its Alumni fail. So he became a food critic, feared and respected throughout the land in equal measure. His words could make or break a resturant, and when he found yours, he decided to take his revenge.

A terrible, scathing, brutal review all but closed down the resturant you worked at. Now without a job, your name in tatters, you do the one thing you can do: Set out to prove the Critic wrong.

Approaching the Critic's lair with nothing but a satchel of ingredients and a few jotted down recipes, you seek the Critic to get a chance of redemption. And if that is denied - revenge.
