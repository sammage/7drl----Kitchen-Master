This game was made for the 7DRL competition 2012. In the 7DRL you have to make a roguelike in just 7 seven days - so if you find any bugs, that's what's to blame, honest! It was made by Sammage. His favorite animal is cats and his favorite colour is 'also cats'. 

The game runs on python, and uses the libtcod library by Doryen. The base of the game was a libtcod roguelike tutorial written by Jotaf.

If you have any bugs or suggestions for improvements, email them to zarquonmk2@gmail.com!
